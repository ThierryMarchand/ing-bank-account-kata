Implementation of User Story 1 to 4

The interface class to deposit/widthdraw money on account or get balance of account
is the Account Service class

The interface class to get all transactions is the Transaction class

The application uses an H2 in memory database. Of course it's not this solution that
would be use in an in production application

No Rest API for current application due to lack of time

Unit tests are in /test/java
